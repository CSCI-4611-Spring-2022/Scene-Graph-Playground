# Scene Graph Playground

This interactive [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/) example demonstrates how 2D transformations are applied to parent and child nodes in a scene graph.  As an added bonus, it also shows how to create multiple instances of a geometric object using a symbol.

You can run the deployed program in your web browser here: https://csci-4611-spring-2022.github.io/Scene-Graph-Playground/

## Prerequisites

To work with this code, you will first need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

## Running

You will need to set up the initial project by pulling the dependencies from the node package manager with:

```
npm install
```

After that, you can compile and run a server with:

```
npm run start
```

Webpack should launch your program in a web browser automatically.  If not, you can run it by pointing your browser at `http://localhost:8080`.
